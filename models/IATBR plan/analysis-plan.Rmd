## Simplified model structure

Two independence categories:

1. With household adults
2. Without household adults

Use a cross-nested model to see which of these two nests someone fits into 
if we know they were with non-household member but we don't know if it was
an adult or not.

Two mode categories:

1. Active
2. Motorized
