# Simplified model structure

Two independence categories:

1. With household adults
2. Without household adults

Two mode categories:

1. Active
2. Motorized

Four combined categories:

1. Active with parent
2. Active without parent
3. Car with parent
4. Car without parent

## Results:

### Unnested model:

* log likelihood: -1447.855
* Significant predictors:
    * All three alternative specific constants (reference is car with parent)
    * Age
        * Positive for active independent
        * Negative for active with parent
    * Child's sex
        * Negative for active independent
    * Density
        * Positive for both active alternatives
    * Distance
        * Negative for both active alternatives
    * Non-working mom
        * Negative for both independent alternatives
        * Positive for walk with parent
    * Vehicle per driver
        * Negative for walk with parent
        
### Mode-based nests:

* log likelihood: -1447.621
* Nests not valid (nesting coefficients not sig greater than one.)

### Independence-based nestsL

* Failed to converge

# Further simplification

Three alternative.
Remove car without parents from sample - this is a total of 65
observations out of 1658 (4%)

## Results:

### Unnested model:

* log likelihood: -1188.731
* Significant predictors (same as with four alternatives):
    * Both alternative specific constants (reference is car with parent)
    * Age
        * Positive for active independent
        * Negative for active with parent
    * Child's sex
        * Negative for active independent
    * Density
        * Positive for both active alternatives
    * Distance
        * Negative for both active alternatives
    * Non-working mom
        * Negative for walk alone
        * Positive for walk with parent
    * Vehicle per driver
        * Negative for walk with parent
        
### Mode-based nests:

* log likelihood: -1188.668
* Nests not valid (nesting coefficient not sig greater than one.)

### Independence-based nests:

* log-likelihood: -1188.509
* Nests not valid (nesting coefficient not sig greater than one)

### Cross-nested with alpha = 0.5
